# Ciao!

I am Alessandro, 26 years old, from [Lecce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdYtSIDzN00&t). In 2014 I moved to [Milan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL_-mC7DHs8) to study "Ingegneria Informatica" at Politecnico di Milano. 
I got my Bachelor Degree and decided to keep on studying in this wonderful city, so I enrolled in the Master program "Computer Science and Engineering", focusing on AI and Machine Learning. 

At the end of my studies, I had the amazing opportunity of working on a couple of research projects with the Institute of Applied Computational Science at Harvard University, and we published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05074) at the NIPS 2020 Workshop [Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2020/).

In this moment I'm working as a Machine Learning Engineer at Casavo.

In this page I will collect some bits of my academic and job career, and whatever I'd like to share with the rest of the world.

Casavo is a proptech born in 2017, whose mission is to change how people sell, buy and live houses in Europe. They are currently one of the most flourishing start-ups in Italy and I just joined their team of ML Engineers and Data Scientists. I'm looking forward to seeing what my skills can boost Casavo's business ðŸš€.

Moviri combines big data engineering and data science expertise to build bespoke, end-to-end business analytics solutions at scale, creating unique value for our customers through cross-industry innovation. The following is a summary of the activities I carried on during my time there.


- Anomaly detection on financial time series (Python, Splunk)
- Network analysis for incident prediction (Python, NetworkX, Neo4j)
- POC to automatically translate Naturale Language into SQL query (Python, PyTorch, Huggingface, Flask, AWS)
- Design of project solutions for a range of clients
- In charge of the technical assessment of the recruitment process

</a>
I founded a student association that has the aim of connecting the world of work with the academic one, focusing on the data science field. 

- Arranged 10+ talks and meet-ups with prestigious companies and professors, with 50+ attendees
- Published articles and course notes in Data Science topics
- Gave educational support to younger students willing to pursue a Data Science career

## :mag_right: Projects I've done...
[Semi-supervised NNs for COVID-19, published at NIPS 2020 Workshop](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/semi_supervised_nn_for_covid19/blob/master/README.md) -  In this work, we study the spread of COVID-19 using a semi-supervised neural network and assuming a passive part of the population remains isolated from the virus dynamics.<br><br />
