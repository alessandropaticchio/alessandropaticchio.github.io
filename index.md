# Ciao!

I am Alessandro, 26 years old, from [Lecce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdYtSIDzN00&t). In 2014 I moved to [Milan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL_-mC7DHs8) to study "Ingegneria Informatica" at Politecnico di Milano. 
I got my Bachelor Degree and decided to keep on studying in this wonderful city, so I enrolled in the Master program "Computer Science and Engineering", focusing on AI and Machine Learning. 

At the end of my studies, I had the amazing opportunity of working on a couple of research projects with the Institute of Applied Computational Science at Harvard University, and we published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05074) at the NIPS 2020 Workshop [Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2020/).

In this moment I'm working as a Data Scientist at Moviri, where I leverage my expertise to solve our customers' business problems with the help of Machine Learning and Analytics.

In this page I will collect some bits of my academic and job career, and whatever I'd like to share with the rest of the world.

## :mag_right: Projects I've done...
[Semi-supervised NNs for COVID-19, published at NIPS 2020 Workshop](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/semi_supervised_nn_for_covid19/blob/master/README.md) -  In this work, we study the spread of COVID-19 using a semi-supervised neural network and assuming a passive part of the population remains isolated from the virus dynamics.<br><br />
[Improving Transfer Learning](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/improving-transfer-learning) - My Master's thesis in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, developed at Harvard University. Improving domain-specific transfer learning for image recognition and differential equations.<br><br />
[From Potential To Rays](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/from_potential_to_rays/tree/main) -  In this research project we leveraged Deep Learning to study a well-known optics problem, namely trying to predict where caustics will emerge, given the position and the intensity of the rays hitting a surface.<br><br />
[Breanna](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/Breanna) - A Python implementation of a tool to manage advertising campaign data and build Machine Learning models on them.<br><br />
[MSL-Datashack2019](https://alefac912.github.io/MSL-datashack2019/) - Breanna... explained.<br><br />
[Lorenzo il Magnifico](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/Lorenzo-il-Magnifico) - Java implementation of board Game "Lorenzo il Magnifico".<br><br />
[Sales prediction for Data Mining course](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/DMTM_2018-Sales-prediction) - A bunch of Python notebooks we used for our Data Mining and Text Mining project.<br><br />
[Artificial Neural Networks Labs](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/Artificial-Neural-Networks-Labs) - Container of all the homeworks for Artificial Neural Networks course at Chalmers.<br><br />
[Fake News Detector](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/Fake-News-Detector) - A Deep Learning pipeline to train a fake news detector <br><br />
[Configuration service](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/Configuration-service) - A Python implementation of a configuration service, accessible via HTTP API.<br><br />
[Come ti Watt?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O-UVBmKltH2T59ys2OGewfCoXA468vHI/view?usp=sharing) - Concept of a mobile application with the aim of raising awareness for energy saving and renewable resources. The client of the project was Edison, Italy #1 energy provider.<br><br />
