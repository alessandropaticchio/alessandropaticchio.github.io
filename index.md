# Hello!

I am Alessandro, 24 years old, from [Lecce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdYtSIDzN00&t=52s). In 2014 I moved to [Milan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL_-mC7DHs8) to study "Ingegneria Informatica" at Politecnico di Milano. 
I got my Bachelor Degree and decided to keep on studying in this wonderful city, so I enrolled in the Master program "Computer Science and Engineering", focusing on AI and Machine Learning. 
In this moment I'm about to finish my studies, and I'm looking for interesting job opportunities...

In this page I will collect some bits of my academic and job career, and whatever I'd like to share with the rest of the world.
