# Ciao!

I am Alessandro, 28 years old, from [Lecce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdYtSIDzN00&t). In 2014 I moved to [Milan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL_-mC7DHs8) to study "Ingegneria Informatica" at **Politecnico di Milano**. 
I got my Bachelor Degree and decided to keep on studying here, so I enrolled in the Master program "**Computer Science and Engineering**", focusing on **AI and Machine Learning**. 
During the program, I also spent one semester abroad at **Chalmers University of Technology**, in **Gothenburg, Sweden**.

At the end of my studies, I had the amazing opportunity of working on a couple of research projects with the **Institute of Applied Computational Science at Harvard University**, and we published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05074) at the NIPS 2020 Workshop [Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2020/).

In this moment I'm working as a **Data Scientist at [Casavo](https://casavo.com/it/)**.

In this page I will collect some bits of my academic and job career, and whatever I'd like to share with the rest of the world.

[Casavo](https://casavo.com/it/) is a proptech born in 2017, whose mission is to change how people sell, buy and live houses in Europe. I'm currently leading a team of 3 Data Scientists in the Pricing Tribe, and I have end-to-end ownership of strategic Data Science initiatives for all the EU countries in which Casavo operates. Following you can find a not-exhaustive list of projects I worked on at Casavo:
  
- EVA, Casavo's Automatic Valuation Model (**Python, LightGBM, Docker, DVC, MLFlow, AWS**)
- Brunelleschi, a Language Model that extracts information from property descriptions (**Python, Pytorch, Huggingface, OpenAI, Docker, DVC, MLFlow, AWS**) ... [watch a Demo here!!!](https://youtu.be/ILyLISZon2M)
- Cloyster, a Computer Vision classifier that catches buildings in bad conditions (**Python, Pytorch, Docker, DVC, MLFlow, AWS**)
- Doduo, a tool that finds duplicated online listings by using Network Science (**Python, NetworkX, Docker, Argo Workflow**)

## :exclamation: Most relevant personal projects...

[Semi-supervised NNs for COVID-19, published at NIPS 2020 Workshop](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/semi_supervised_nn_for_covid19/blob/master/README.md) -  In this work, we study the spread of COVID-19 using a semi-supervised neural network and assuming a passive part of the population remains isolated from the virus dynamics. We applied a novel method to solve **differential equations** with **Neural Networks**. (**Python, Pytorch**) <br><br/>
[From Potential To Rays](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/from_potential_to_rays/tree/main) -  In this research project we leveraged Deep Learning to study a well-known optics problem, namely trying to predict where caustics will emerge, given the position and the intensity of the rays hitting a surface. The proposed architecture consists of two **Variational Autoencoders** and a **Feed-Forward Network** to map the two latent spaces. (**Python, Pytorch**)<br><br />
[Neural Style Transfer - Pytorch implementation](https://github.com/alessandropaticchio/neural_style_transfer/) - A Pytorch implementation of the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Gatys et al. Neural Style Transfer is an optimization technique to manipulate an image and apply the visual appearance of another one. (**Python, Pytorch**) <br><br />

[Moviri Analytics](https://www.moviri.com/analytics/) combines big data engineering and data science expertise to build bespoke, end-to-end business analytics solutions at scale, creating unique value for our customers through cross-industry innovation. The following is a summary of the activities I carried on during my time there as a Data Scientist.


- Anomaly detection on financial time series (**Python, Splunk**)
- Network analysis for incident prediction (**Python, NetworkX, Neo4j**)
- POC to automatically translate Naturale Language into SQL query (**Python, PyTorch, Huggingface, Flask, AWS**)
- Design of project solutions for a range of clients
- In charge of the technical assessment of the recruitment process

[Institute of Applied Computational Science at Harvard (IACS)](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/) is the home for students and faculty who are tackling major challenges in science and the world through the use of computational methods.
I was selected to work on a combined Data Science project, delivered by Politecnico di Milano and Institute of Applied Computational Science ad Harvard University, regarding advertising strategy optimization.

Consequently, we started a research collaboration to work on my Master Thesis, whose title is: "Improving domain-specific Transfer Learning applications in Image Recognition and Differential Equations".

Lastly, we worked on the application of semi-supervised learning for the estimation of the basic reproduction number of COVID-19, more info the projects section.
  
Our research collaboration lasted about one year after my graduation.
